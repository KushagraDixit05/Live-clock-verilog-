Digital Clock in Verilog

This project simulates a 24-hour digital clock using Verilog. The clock starts from a user-defined initial time and counts every second, displaying the time in HH:MM:SS format.

Files Included:

Digital_Clock.v – Verilog module for the digital clock

Digital_Clock_tb.v – Testbench for simulating the clock

run_digital_clock.tcl – TCL script to simulate the clock for 1 hour

README.txt – Project information

Features:

24-hour format (00:00:00 to 23:59:59)

Custom initial time using inputs

Real-time simulation for 1 hour

Time printed every second in terminal

How to Run:

Open your Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim).

Compile the Verilog files:

nginx
Copy
Edit
vlog Digital_Clock.v Digital_Clock_tb.v
Run the testbench using the TCL script:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
vsim -c work.Digital_Clock_tb -do run_digital_clock.tcl
This will simulate the clock for 3600 seconds (1 hour) with output printed every second.

Edit Initial Time:

In Digital_Clock_tb.v, change these lines to set your desired start time:

verilog
Copy
Edit
init_hours = 2;
init_minutes = 52;
init_seconds = 0;
Modify Simulation Duration:

In run_digital_clock.tcl, update this line to change duration:

tcl
Copy
Edit
for {set i 0} {$i < 3600} {incr i} {
Change 3600 to however many seconds you want the simulation to run.

Example Output (in terminal):
